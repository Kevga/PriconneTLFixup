# PriconneTLFixup

Fixes a couple issues when using XUAT with Priconne, as well as adding QoL features.

## Features
- **Removes the typewriter effect** from all dialog, improving the speed and accuracy of the translation.
- **Adds subtitles to all movies**, even if you downloaded them with audio. Usually they only show up if you download without voices.
- **Translates subtitles before they are displayed**, so you don't have to wait for the translation to happen.
- **Adds number separators** to most large numbers in the game, removing the need to count endless zeroes.
- Allows you to **resize the game window to any size**, instead of being limited to 720p. Also enables the maximize button.
- Automatically **closes the Sugoi translation backend terminal window** when you close the game, should you use that.

## Fixes
- Fixes the monster detail window becoming unreadable after translation.
- Fixes skill bubbles not disappearing after translation.
- Fixes issues with story dialog not translating or even disappearing after the character name gets translated.
- Fixes text overflowing various dialog boxes and speech bubbles.
- Fixes various issues with font sizes.
